Kirchzettel
===========
Create various church bulletins in Microsoft Word format from a JSON calendar source.

Author: Christoph Fischer, christoph.fischer@elkw.de

This collection of scripts creates several kinds of preconfigured church bulletin files from 
a list of events provided in JSON format. The event list follows the same format as is needed
for [FullCalendar.js](https://fullcalendar.io/).

## How to install

- Clone the Git repository to a directory on your web server.
- Import dependencies with `composer install`
- Copy `Configuration/Kirchzettel.dist.yaml` to `Configuration/Kirchzettel.yaml` and edit the file to suit your needs. Be sure to provide at least a source URL for your JSON list.
- Base your output formats on the two classes provided here (`KirchzettelDocument` and `BekanntgabenDocument`), or
  create entirely new descendants of `AbstractDocument`.
- Build a form that calls `index.php?format=YourFormat` (which would then depend on a class called `YourFormatDocument`) and send the necessary arguments you need for your output.
